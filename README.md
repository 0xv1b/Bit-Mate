# Bit Mate

Bit Mate is a tool to automate farming in Bit Heroes, this allows us to easily collect information about in game drop rates to generate our own estimates.
We provide a simple GUI interface that allows you to configure what and how to farm, these and other values are stored in the Config/Config.toml file, and may be edited there directly as well.
