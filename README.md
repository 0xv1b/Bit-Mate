# Bit Mate

*Bit Mate* is a tool to automate farming in Bit Heroes, this allows us to easily collect information about in game drop rates to generate our own estimates.

We provide a simple GUI interface that allows you to configure what and how to farm, these and other values are stored in the `Config/Config.toml` file, and may be edited there directly as well.
