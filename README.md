# Bit Mate

*Bit Mate* is a tool to automate farming in Bit Heroes, this allows us to easily collect information about in game drop rates to generate our own estimates.

We provide a simple GUI interface that allows you to configure what and how to farm, these and other values are stored in the `Config/Config.toml` file, and may be edited there directly as well.

Please remember that the Bit Heroes app must be active and not covered by other applications as the tool works by clicking coordinates on the screen, if the Bit Heroes application is covered by another application  (`eg: You have this GUI tool over it rather than to the side`) then it will not function properly.
