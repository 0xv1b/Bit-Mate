# Bit Mate

*Bit Mate* is a tool to automate farming in Bit Heroes, this allows us to easily collect information about in game drop rates to generate our own estimates.


> **Disclaimer:** The following is a purely educational project and is not intended to gain an advantage over other players, this tool is designed specifically with obtaining drop rate information, etc, in mind and has gone out its way not to including cheating mechanics such as auto-fishing. 

> We do not condone the usage of this tool for any purposes without the permission of relevant parties.


We provide a simple GUI interface that allows you to configure what and how to farm, these and other values are stored in the `Config/Config.toml` file, and may be edited there directly as well.

Please remember that the Bit Heroes app must be active and not covered by other applications as the tool works by clicking coordinates on the screen, if the Bit Heroes application is covered by another application  (`eg: You have this GUI tool over it rather than to the side`) then it will not function properly.


### Installation & Running
To install please download the Installer and select a location on your machine where the application should be installed. Once the files have been installed, open the terminal in the '/src' folder and run the command `pythonw main.py` or Windows users may also simply choose to double click and run the `BitMate.bat` file.
